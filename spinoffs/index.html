			<h1>Spinoff Projects</h1>

<h2>PHT</h2>

<p> We are delighted to announce the first actual spin-off from <span
class="phc">phc</span>. Written by Daniel Barreiro, <tt>PHT</tt> embeds
HTML/XML into PHP to ensure that the XML or HTML output by PHP scripts is
well-formed and (although this has not yet been implemented) valid. Details and
source can be found at <a
href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/pht/">http://www.satyam.com.ar/pht/</a>. </p>

<h2>Plumhead</h2>

Plumhead is written by Bernhard Schmalhofer and attempts to implement PHP on
Parrot by taking the XML output from <span class="phc">phc</span> and
transforming it (using XSLT) to the Parrot internal representation. See <a
href="http://rakudo.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead">http://rakudo.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead</a>
for more information.

			<h1>Suggestions</h1>

<p> Below is a list of other projects that we'd love to see built.  All of
these tools are very difficult to implement starting from scratch.  With <span
class="phc">phc</span> as a base from which to work, the burden of developing
any of these tools should be greatly reduced.  </p>

<h2><a name="refactoring">Refactoring Tool</a></h2>

<p> According to <a
href="http://www.refactoring.com">www.refactoring.com</a>, refactoring
is <i>a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of
code, altering its internal structure without changing its external
behavior</i>.  A simple example of refactoring is renaming a variable
name or a function name.  More complex refactoring may involve finding
repeated blocks of code inside a script and moving them to a function.
</p>

<p> While simple refactorings can be coded directly in <span
class="phc">phc</span> (see for example the <a
href="../doc/manual/demo.html">Demo</a>), a dedicated refactoring tool based on
<span class="phc">phc</span> would make this process much easier for the
end-user. It could even provide a graphical user interface offering
common refactoring tasks, so that the programmer does not need to
write any code at all to refactor their code. </p>

<p> We are planning to include type inference in <span class="phc">phc</span>
at some point, which should increase the usefulness of <span
class="phc">phc</span> for refactoring greatly (see <a
href="../whatsinstore.html">What's in Store?</a>).  </p>

<p> See also <a href="../doc/manual/tutorial2.html">Tutorial 2</a> for an
example of a useful refactoring for PHP. </p>

<h2><a name="style">Style Checker</a></h2>

<p> Software companies often have a series of &ldquo;programming style
guidelines&rdquo; that dictate how classes, methods and variables should be
named, if and where there are compulsory comments, etc. This is useful to make
sure that code written by different programmers looks the same. This is also
useful in open source projects, with lots of programmers working on the same
codebase. </p>

<p> A style checker is a tool that knows about these guidelines and is able to
check whether a particular program adheres to them. It is possible to write a
style checker for a particular set of guidelines directly. However, a dedicated
tool for style checking should be able to read in a set of guidelines (either in
text form or using a GUI) and verify programs according to them. </p>

<p> Note that <span class="phc">phc</span> records line number and comments in
the generated tree, so that they can be used in the verification process too.
</p>

<h2><a name="aspect">Aspect Weaver</a></h2>

<p> Aspect oriented programming is a relatively new programming paradigm. The
standard example to explain what AOP does for you is the following. Suppose you
have a script with a series of functions. Say you want to start and end every
function with a call to some logging function: </p>

<pre>
&lt;?<b>php</b>
   <b>function</b> some_function
   {
      log("some_function: begin");

      <i>/* do whatever the function should do */</i>

      log("some_function: end");
   }
?&gt;
</pre>

<p> And say you want to do that in each and every function, for example for
debugging purposes. It's a lot of work to do that manually for every function.
And when you no longer need it, it is a lot of work to remove it again. This is
what's known as a <i>cross-cutting concern</i>: something you need to implement
(in this example, logging), that &ldquo;cross-cuts&ldquo; (affects) a lot of
code. With AOP, you can write this concern as a single &ldquo;aspect&rdquo;.
You then run your program through an &ldquo;aspect weaver&rdquo;, which will
insert the necessary code at the start and end of each function, thus saving
you a lot of work. </p>

<p> For more information, check out AspectJ, an aspect weaver for Java
(<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">www.eclipse.org/aspectj</a>), or
read for example <i>AspectJ in Action</i> by Ramnivas Laddad. You can do
some very slick things with aspect oriented programming :-) </p>

<p> <span class="phc">phc</span> would be a good foundation upon which to build
an aspect weaver for PHP. </p>

<h2><a name="obfuscate">Script Obfuscator</a></h2>

Most PHP scripts are distributed in source form. But what if you don't want
people to modify your code? Or what if you want to make your code as
difficult to understand as possible, so that it becomes harder to analyse it
for possible attacks? A script obfuscator takes a PHP script and outputs
another PHP script that does the same thing, but is completely unreadable.
There are a few obfuscators available for PHP, but a script obfuscator based on
<span class="phc">phc</span> can make use of a lot of structural information
about the script, opening new avenues for great obfuscation :-) 

<h2><a name="optimize">Script Optimizer</a></h2>

Similar to a script obfuscator, a script optimizer takes a PHP script and
outputs another PHP script that does the same thing, but runs much faster. As a
simple example, consider

<pre>
&lt;?<b>php</b>
   <b>echo</b> "Text $with variables.";
?&gt;
</pre>

This could be changed to

<pre>
&lt;?<b>php</b>
   <b>echo</b> 'Text ', $with, ' variables.';
?&gt;
</pre>

which should run faster. Many other optimizations are possible.

<h2><a name="pretty">Pretty Printers</a></h2>

<p> <span class="phc">phc</span> includes a standard pretty printer that
outputs the AST (<span class="phc">phc</span>'s internal representation of a
script) into normal PHP, but it is rather limited. For example, it cannot be
configured. Moreover, it can probably be improved in a number of places. For
example, it really should deal better with brackets in expressions (at the
moment, it simply copies the brackets from the user).  </p>

<p> A pretty printer would take an AST and output it in some way. For example,
it could output the AST to normal PHP code, but in a different layout style
than the standard unparser does. But you could also think of other unparsers.
For example, it might output to HTML or Latex, so that you can include PHP
examples in HTML websites or in Latex documents. </p>

<p> Since version 0.1.6., the <span class="phc">phc</span> unparser is defined
as a tree visitor, so it is possible to define new unparsers by inheriting from
the <code>PHP_unparser</code> class, and redefining only those features that
need to be improved. </p>

<h2><a name="translate">Language Translation</a></h2>

Tools that translate PHP into other languages (for example, a PHP to ASP
translator). Note that this is a much more difficult task than the other
projects mentioned, and such a tool would benefit greatly from future additions
to <span class="phc">phc</span> itself (which is, after all, a compiler).

<h2><a name="semantic">Semantic Checker</a></h2>

Like a style checker, a semantic checker does not actually modify a PHP script,
but checks it instead for &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;. For example, it could issue a
warning in the following code

<pre>
&lt;?<b>php</b>
   $a = "some text " + $b; 
?&gt;
</pre>

(The <code>+</code> should probably have been a <code>.</code>). This
project will also benefit from future releases of <span
class="phc">phc</span> (see <a href="../whatsinstore.html">What's in
Store?</a>).
