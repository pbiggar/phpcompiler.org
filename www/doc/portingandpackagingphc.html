			<h1>We need porters, packagers and maintainers</h1>

			<p>Now that <span class="phc">phc</span> has a plugin architecture, it
			is no longer necessary for users to integrate their source with it. As
			a result, it is much more useful to package <span
			class="phc">phc</span> and integrate it within various distributions'
			package management systems. If you are interested in packaging <span
			class="phc">phc</span> for your favourite OS, please <a
			href="../contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

			<p>Currently, <span class="phc">phc</span> runs on x86 Linux. Most of
			the testing occurs on i686 Ubuntu Dapper and i686 Debian Etch, with
			occasional testing on Darwin, and infrequent testing on sparc Solaris
			(SunOS 5.9).  If you have access to other machines, architectures or
			operating systems, and would be willing to test <span
			class="phc">phc</span> on it, please <a href="../contact.html">contact
			us</a>.</p>

			<h1>Packaging hints</h1>
			<p>Do not strip the binaries. Since the plugins use <tt>dlopen()</tt>,
			and link dynamically against the <tt><span
			class="phc">phc</span></tt>, the plugins will not work unless the
			symbol information is available.</p>



			<h1>Test suite</h1>

			<p>Although we included tests in <span class="phc">phc</span> up to
			version 0.1.5.1-1, it is no longer practical to do so, mostly due to
			the size of the regression tests.  However, in order to help potential
			porters and maintainers, we provide the <a
			href="../src/tests-VERSION.tar.bz2">full test suite</a> (20MB).  Extract
			the tests in the <tt>src/</tt> directory, and run</p>

<pre>
make test
</pre>
			<p> to run the short version of the tests, or</p>
<pre>
make long-test
</pre>

			<p>to run the entire suite. Note that the line numbers test is
			expected to fail (this is a known bug and will be fixed in a later
			release). </p>

			<h1><span class="phc">phc</span> packages</h1>

			<p>See the <a href=../src/index.html>downloads page</a> for existing
			packages. In addition, we're looking for people to create and/or
			maintain packages for more systems, including Debian/Ubuntu
			(especially Debian/Ubuntu), Gentoo, Slackware, Darwin and Solaris.
