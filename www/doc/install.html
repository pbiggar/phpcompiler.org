			<h1>System Requirements</h1>

			<div class="warningbox">
				These instructions have been updated for version 0.1.7.
			</div>

			<p> <span class="phc">phc</span> needs a Unix-like environment to run
			(it has been tested on Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X). To
			compile <span class="phc">phc</span>, you will need

			<ul>
			<li><code>gcc</code> version <b>3.4.0</b> or higher (other compilers may work too, but they need to support covariant return types; YMMV)
			<li><code>make</code>
			</ul>

			<p>To make full use of <span class="phc">phc</span>, you will also
			need</p>

			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces-C++</a> if you
			want support for XML parsing  (you don't need Xerces for XML
			unparsing). 
			<li>a DOT viewer such as <a
			href="http://www.graphviz.org">graphviz</a> if you want to be able to
			view the graphical output generated by <span class="phc">phc</span>
			(for example, syntax trees)
			</ul>

			<p> Finally, if you want to modify the internals of <span
			class="phc">phc</span> (in other ways than through the explicit API we
			provide for doing so), you will need the following tools: </p>

			<ul>
			<li><code>flex</code> (if you need to modify the lexical analyser)
			<li><code>bison</code> (if you need to modify the syntax analyser)
			<li><code>patch</code> (if you modify either the lexical or the syntax analyser)
			<li><a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">ghc</a> (to compile <span class="phc">maketea</span>, which is written in Haskell; you will need to compile <span class="phc">maketea</span> either if you want to modify the <span class="phc">phc</span> grammar (not an easy thing to do), or modify <span class="phc">maketea</span> itself)
			<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html">gengetopt</a> (if you need to add additional command line arguments; you will need version 0.16 or higher)
			<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/gperf.html">gperf</a> (if you need to modify the list of keywords recognized by the lexical analyser)
			</ul>

			<p> However, most people should not need these tools (even if you are
			implementing tools based on <span class="phc">phc</span>). </p>

			<p> It is possible to link <span class="phc">phc</span> to the Boehm
			garbage collector (known as <code>libgc</code> in many Linux
			distributions), but this feature is experimental and seems to lead to
			runtime errors on some systems. Use with care. </p> 

			<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

			<p>First of all, you must <a href="../src/index.html">download</a> the
			latest release of <span class="phc">phc</span>, and save it to some
			temporary location, for example <code>/tmp</code>. If
			<code>VERSION</code> is the version number of the copy of <span
			class="phc">phc</span> you have downloaded, the file will be called
			<code>phc-VERSION.tar.gz</code>. Thus, you should now have a file
			<code>/tmp/phc-VERSION.tar.gz</code> (for example,
			<code>/tmp/phc-0.1.6.tar.gz</code>). </p>
		
			<p> Next you must decide where you want to extract <span
			class="phc">phc</span>. Here, we will assume that you want to extract
			it to your home directory (<code>~</code>). Extract <span
			class="phc">phc</span> as follows.	</p>

<pre>
cd ~
tar xvfz /tmp/phc-VERSION.tar.gz
</pre>
	
			<p> This will create a new directory <code>~/phc-VERSION</code>
			that contains the <span class="phc">phc</span> source tree. Finally,
			you must compile <span class="phc">phc</span>. You should be able to
			simply type </p>

<pre>
cd ~/phc-VERSION
./configure
make
</pre>

			<p> This should compile without any warnings or errors. If this
			step fails, please send a bug report to the <a
			href="../contact.html">mailing list</a> with as much information
			about your system as you can give, and we will try to resolve it.
			Finally, install <span class="phc">phc</span> using </p>

<pre>
make install
</pre>

			<p> For information on running <span class="phc">phc</span>, see <a
			href="runningphc.html">Running phc</a>.  If
			you can follow those instructions and you get the output you should
			get, congratulations!  You have successfully installed <span
			class="phc">phc</span> :-) </p>
