				<h1>What is <span class="phc">phc</span>?</h1>

				<p> <span class="phc">phc</span> is a framework for static analysis
				of PHP scripts, PHP source to source transformations, and
				ultimately compiling PHP scripts down to native machine code. </p>
			
				<p> The current release <b>does not yet compile PHP</b> and is
				therefore not yet useful for end-users. It is however useful for
				writing tools that operate on PHP scripts, such as refactoring
				tools, aspect weavers, or obfuscators (see <a
				href="spinoffs/index.html">Spinoffs</a> for some other
				suggestions). See <a href="whatsinstore.html">What's in Store</a>
				to get an idea of what is planned for next releases of <span
				class="phc">phc</span>. </p>

				<p> <span class="phc">phc</span> provides the programmer with a <a
				href="doc/dev_manual/grammar.html">well-defined</a> representation of PHP
				scripts (an abstract syntax tree or AST), an <a
				href="doc/dev_manual/index.html">API</a> to define analyses and
				transformations over this representation, and an unparser to output
				the AST back to PHP syntax. See the <a
				href="doc/dev_manual/demo.html">Demo</a> for a quick idea of what <span
				class="phc">phc</span> can do for you, or the <a
				href="doc/dev_manual/index.html">Documentation</A> to get started with <span
				class="phc">phc</span>.</p>

				<h2>New: XML support</h2>

				<p> If you are not comfortable with C++, or for some other reason
				would prefer not to work directly with the <span
				class="phc">phc</span> framework, <span class="phc">phc</span>
				might still be useful to you, because it can output the AST to <a
				href="doc/user_manual/runningphc.html#xml">XML format</a>.
				Moreover, <span class="phc">phc</span> is also able to read this
				XML back in, and can write it back to PHP syntax. This means that
				you can write applications that operate on PHP scripts in XML
				syntax, using our abstract syntax for PHP, and use <span
				class="phc">phc</span> to convert from PHP syntax to XML syntax and
				back. </p>

				<h1>News</h1>
			
				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2007jan17">17 January 2007</a></i>. The <span
				class="phc">phc</span> SVN repository is now publicly available.
				Read the <a
				href="https://altoure.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pipermail/phc-general/2007-January/000201.html">announcement</a>
				for more details. </p>

				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2006sept09">8 September 2006</a></i>. We
				are delighted to announce the first spin-off based on <span
				class="phc">phc</span>. Written by Daniel Barreiro, it embeds
				HTML/XML into PHP. See <a href="spinoffs">spinoffs</a> for details.
				In further news, we have released version <b>0.1.7</b> as no major
				programs were reported in 0.1.7rc2, and we have added a new article
				on <a href="articles/reentrantparser.html">writing a reentrant
				parser with Bison and Flex</a>. </p>

				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2006july21">21 July 2006</a></i>. Fixed a
				few (minor) user-reported bugs in <b>0.1.7rc2</b>. </p>

				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2006july13">13 July 2006</a></i>.
				Released version <b>0.1.7rc1</b>. We now support extending <span
				class="phc">phc</span> through <b>plugins</b>: it is no longer
				necessary to re-compile <span class="phc">phc</span> to add
				functionality to it! This also should make binary packages for
				<span class="phc">phc</span> much more useful. See the <a
				href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details. </p>  

				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2006july07">7 July 2006</a></i>. Bugfix
				(<b>0.1.6rc2</b>). Scripts with open ended PHP (no closing tag) had
				an extraneous echo at the end; also, use of identifiers as array
				indices inside strings caused the identifier to be duplicated in
				the string to follow the variable access. </p>

				<p> <i><a href="news.html#2006july04">4 July 2006</a></i>. After a
				long period of no releases, we are happy to announce version
				<b>0.1.6rc1</b>. New in this release are an improved tree
				transformation API, support for pattern matching on AST nodes, an
				XML unparser, and various other features and bugfixes. As always,
				see <a href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details. </p>
