		<h1>How to help</h1>	

			Skills:

			If you have any of the following skills, or are willing to learn them,
			we could do with your help: (if you dont know what to do, but want to
			help, ask us on the phc-general list, we're friendly).

			C/Zend API:

				If you're familiar with the Zend API, the most important work we
				need completed is code generation. We currently dont support PHP's
				OO features in our compiled code, and this is probably our highest
				priority.

			C++:

				The compiler is written in C++, and most changes require some C++.
				Fortunately, most of the C++ we use is simple, and the only
				exceptions (templates) are rare. A good way to find things to do is
				to grep the current sources for TODO comments.

			C:
				Some important parts of the compiler are written in C, such as the
				parser and lexer. We have a number of parser/unparser bugs, which
				mostly need to be solved in the parser. Knowledge of flex/bison is
				useful for solving these.

				If you know C, perhaps you'd like to look at code generation. Even
				if you arent familiar with the Zend API, you can learn it through
				reading the current code we generate, looking at the PHP sources
				(in the Zend folder), or through reading Sara Golemons book.

			PHP:

				Our test framework needs a lot of love. The most important fix is to support the PHPT tests from PHP.

				We have a test bot (see test/framework/records), that checks out
				each version from our repository, builds it, tests it, and records
				the results. Issue 61 details a number of changes we'd like to more
				fully test each revision.

			Haskell:

				Most of phc is run on code generated by our other project, maketea.
				Bugs labeled as Maketea should be fixed within maketea (though we
				use the phc mailing list for this).

			Autotools/Makefiles:

				The issues list a number of bugs in autotools.


			Bug reporters:

				If you dont have time to contribute, please try building and
				installing phc, running the tests, and submitting
				tests/logs/latest/results to us. We'll be able to review that and
				check if it looks as it should.

				Please also try to compile/run/pretty-print your own code with phc.
				Let us know how you get on.

			Packagers:

			Package phc for your OS. Also package the php5-embed SAPI, which we need for applications.

			
			Still interested:

			Announce yourselves on the mailing list

			Read the internals list (even if there is little there).



			Mailing lists:

			phc-general is for questions where most users of the phc may be
			interested in the response. phc-internals is for questions where only
			the developers and contributors would be interested. It also receives
			an email for each bug update and svn commit. If you are unsure of the
			proper place to send your email, don't worry about it, and try the
			phc-general list. There will be a friendly response there.


			Getting started:

			The documentation describes how most phc passes, which are either
			visitors or transforms, work. Other passes are typically once-off, and
			the code is the documentation. If there is any code where the intent
			and function of the code is not clear from the code/documentation,
			please bring it to our attention, and we will explain it.

			The best place to look for a first taste is the Demo.


			Bug reports:

			Please report bugs directly to phc-general. We can update the issue
			tracker from there. The list archives may provide hints to you, but
			you should feel free to contact us.

			After seeing real bugs, we generally fix them on the spot. Bugs which
			we cannot fix immediately, we add to our bug database.

			If you have a script which shows the bug, that would be incredibly
			helpful. If you are able to fix the bug, please send us patches. We
			will verify them and apply them (and add your name to the contributors
			list). If your program is too long to send as a bug report, our test
			suite includes the reduce.php script. This iteratively removes
			statements from your program, so long as the bug remains. It has in
			the past been useful for reducing test cases, and may be useful for
			you.

			Contributor tools:

				Wiki: Please feel free to put anything on the wiki. Things which turn out to be particularly useful may get rolled into documentation in the future.
				Bugs list:
				Source downloads
				Branches: If you need a branch, please provide a short description of what you need it for. It may be best done in the trunk with a series of patches.

			We use hosting and bug reports on our Google code site. Bugs s
			Use svn
