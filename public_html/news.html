				<p><i><a name="2009feb15">15 February 2009</a></i>.
					<span class="phc">phc</span> version
					<a href="downloads.html">0.2.0.3</a>
					(<a href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>) has been released.  It
					resolved a packaging error in version 0.2.0.2 which prevented
					<span class="phc">phc</span> from building if the PHP embed SAPI
					was not used. We also repackaged 0.2.0.2 to fix the problem.
				</p>


				<p><i><a name="2009jan28">28 January 2009</a></i>.

					0.2.0.1, we have released version 0.2.0.2. <a
					href="downloads.html">Download it</a> or see the <a
					href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
				</p>


				<p><i><a name="2009jan15">15 January 2009</a></i>.
					Due to a severe bug in <span class="phc">phc</span> version
					0.2.0, we have released version 0.2.0.1. <a
					href="downloads.html">Download it</a> or see the <a
					href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2008dec10">10 December 2008</a></i>.
					<span class="phc">phc</span> version
					0.2.0 has been released! This is the first release to support
					compiling PHP code, and supports nearly all features (except
					OO). Read the <a href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
				</p>


				<p><i><a name="2008oct21">21 October 2008</a></i>.
					The first beta release of <span class="phc">phc</span> version
					0.2.0 has been made available. Changes since the alpha include
					fixing garbage collection in the compiler, and bringing the
					documentation up-to-date. Read the <a
					href="http://www.phpcompiler.org/lists/phc-general/2008-October/000880.html">announcement</a>
					for more details.
				</p>


				<p><i><a name="2008oct12">12 October 2008</a></i>.
					As part of a push for greater contributions to <span
					class="phc">phc</span>, the <a
					href="http://www.phpcompiler.org/mailinglist.html">php-internals
					mailing list</a> has been opened up for general membership.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2008sep21-2">21 September 2008</a></i>.
					phpcompiler.org has been given an overhaul. Although most of the
					changes are behind the scenes, we've added a contribution page,
					to make it easier for potential contributors to contribute to
					<span class=phc>phc</span>.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2008sep21">21 September 2008</a></i>.
					The first alpha release of <span class="phc">phc</span> version
					0.2.0 has been made available.  The major change is this is the
					first version which compiles PHP code into an executable, or
					into a C extension.  This allows speed-ups of approximately 1.50
					(programs takes 33% less time to run).
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2007jan17">17 January 2007</a></i>.
					The <span class="phc">phc</span> SVN repository is now publicly
					available.  Read the <a
					href="http://www.phpcompiler.org/lists/phc-general/2007-January/000201.html">announcement</a>
					for more details.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006sept09">8 September 2006</a></i>.
					We are delighted to announce the first spin-off based on <span
					class="phc">phc</span>.  Written by Daniel Barreiro, it embeds
					HTML/XML into PHP. See <a href="downloads.html">spinoffs</a> for
					details.  In further news, we have released version <b>0.1.7</b>
					as no major programs were reported in 0.1.7rc2, and we have
					added a new article on <a
					href="articles/reentrantparser.html">writing a reentrant parser
					with Bison and Flex</a>.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006july21">21 July 2006</a></i>.
					Fixed a few (minor) user-reported bugs in <b>0.1.7rc2</b>.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006july13">13 July 2006</a></i>.
					Released version <b>0.1.7rc1</b>. We now support extending <span
					class="phc">phc</span> through <b>plugins</b>: it is no longer
					necessary to re-compile <span class="phc">phc</span> to add
					functionality to it! This also should make binary packages for
					<span class="phc">phc</span> much more useful. See the <a
					href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006july07">7 July 2006</a></i>.
					Bugfix (<b>0.1.6rc2</b>). Scripts with open ended PHP (no
					closing tag) had an extraneous echo at the end; also, use of
					identifiers as array indices inside strings caused the
					identifier to be duplicated in the string to follow the variable
					access.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006july04">4 July 2006</a></i>.
					After a long period of no releases, we are happy to announce
					version <b>0.1.6rc1</b>. New in this release are an improved
					tree transformation API, support for pattern matching on AST
					nodes, an XML unparser, and various other features and bugfixes.
					As always, see <a href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for
					details.
				</p> 

				<p><i><a name="2006jan27">27 January 2006</a></i>.
					Version 0.1.5 did not compile on systems with old versions of
					Flex. Our apologies. This is solved in <b>0.1.5.1</b>.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006jan26">26 January 2006</a></i>.
					Version <b>0.1.5</b> released. <span class="phc">phc</span> is
					now released under the <b>BSD license</b>. This release also
					contains numerous minor feature enhancements and bug fixes; see
					<a href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2006jan09">9 January 2006</a></i>.
					Lots of minor feature enhancements. See <a
					href="src/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details.
					<b>IMPORTANT</b>: this release is not downwards compatible with
					the previous!
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2005dec01">1 December 2005</a></i>.
					Bug fix. Null vectors are now unparsed properly by the dot
					unparser, and Windows-style line-breaks are handled properly.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2005nov17">17 November 2005</a></i>.
					Added functionality to the TreeTransform API to modify the
					traversal order.  See <a
					href="doc/latest/treetutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a> for details.
				</p>

				<p><i><a name="2005nov02">2 November 2005</a></i>.
					Bug fix. Strings containing variables were not parsed correctly;
					corrected in release <b>0.1.1</b>.

				<p><i><a name="2005sept29">29 September 2005</a></i>.
					First release of <span class="phc">phc</span>! This release
					offers the framework for modifying PHP (parser, unparser, tree
					transformation interface) but as yet nothing else.
